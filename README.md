# üíªüöÄOpenTutor

OpenTutor is an Open Source learning platform built with the goal of being used and maintained **by students for students** to support them in their school or university learning.

## ‚ùìProblem

**Have you ever had a question in class? What options do you have?
- Watch again the recording of the class of the teacher you didn't understand.
- Search for help on the internet, usually on YouTube tutorials.

**But...** However, all the information you find does not use the methodology used at your university or the one your professor uses, so you get more frustrated and do not solve your doubts.

## ‚ö°Proposal

**Student Platform for Students**.  
OpenTutor is an environment designed so that with just a few configurations according to our user manual you can create a learning environment in your University and manage the instructors that will teach the subjects, since everyone can be a student. But, to be an instructor you have to apply yourself and the administrator of this solution in your University will grant you or not the permission to upload content according to the criteria he/she considers such as your grades in the subject you want to upload videos, your teaching skills, the quality of your videos, etc.

## ‚ú®Licence
This project uses a fully OpenSource license that allows you to modify the code, create your own version, make improvements, propose changes and implement it at your University!
